            <p id="introduction">My story as a fan of sonic the hedgehog starts in the year 2000 when my uncle let me play sonic the hedgehog 3 on his pc. I was only 5 years old back then but i got hooked to that game's overall feel inmediately.
                I continued playing all sonic games a could get my hands into and haven't stopped to this day. So to thank this franchize for all the years of entertainment i am making a list of some of my favorite sonic games in no particular order:

                    <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</h3>
                    <p>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platform game. It features a story similar to the first Sonic the Hedgehog's (1991): Doctor Robotnik, a mad scientist, seeks the Chaos Emeralds to power his space station, the Death Egg, and traps the animal inhabitants of West Island in aggressive robots. <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More info.</a></p>

                    <p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. As with Sonic the Hedgehog 2, players can control Sonic, Tails, or both simultaneously. In the former choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately. <a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More info.</a></p>
